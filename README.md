# Book Search App

<br/>

## Overview

This is a simple React application that allows users to search and sort a list of books. Users can search for books by title, author, or genre, as well as sort them alphabetically by the same criteria. The keywords they searched for get highlighted and the books are displayed in two columns, in order from left column top to bottom, to right column top to bottom, just like how you would read a book.
